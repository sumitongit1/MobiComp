# MobiComp
College project on Mobile Comparison using HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript


In this project repo, you will find two folders. One for the front-end which is designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and php and in the other folder you will find an SQL import file which you can use to directly import all the tables used in my project into your database.

Don't forget to edit your database's username, password and database name in each of the php files.

The design has been kept very simple so that you can add your own features to it later or customize it with your own code with it.
